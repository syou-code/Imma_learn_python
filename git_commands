1. First you stage the files
git add . (or you click the checkbox in source tree)

2. Second, you commit the files
git commit -m "add some message here" (same thing as clicking commit on source tree)

3. push to branch
git push -u origin <branch_name> (remove the < >) (same thing as clicking push in source tree.)
